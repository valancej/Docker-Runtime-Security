# Docker Runtime Security

## Introduction

Previously, in our Docker Security Best Practices series, we took a deeper look into Securing the Docker Image, and what best practices to follow. This post will continue the series, focusing on Docker container runtime, the challenges that come with securing them, and what countermeasures can be taken to achieve a better container runtime security stance. Left out from this discussion will be any considerations that touch on host or static image security.
